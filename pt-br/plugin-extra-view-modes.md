# Plugin: Extra View Modes

This plugin adds 8 extra view mode options to the list of view modes available on your Collection settings.

## Introduction

By default, every Tainacan collection can show the item's list with six default view modes:

* Table
* Cards
* Records
* Masonry
* Thumbnails
* Slideshow

Excepting for the last one, they are all available on the admin list view as well. This plugin installs extra view modes that will be visible on the theme side of the instalation (the website itself) and that do not follow Tainacan's default design guidelines. It was created in the early days of Tainacan development to demonstrate the possibility of this kind of customization and serves as a good first step for any developer who wants to learn [how to create your custom view mode](/dev/extra-view-modes). We also cover this possibilty - of using new view modes - [on this post](https://tainacan.org/blog/2018/06/13/custom-view-modes-how-will-the-world-see-your-collection/) in our official page.

The new view modes available are:

* Albums
* Books
* Documents
* Gallery
* Frame
* Mosaic (different from Masonry)
* Polaroid
* Profile

## Instalation

Download the [.zip](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan-extra-viewmodes/archive/master.zip) file from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan-extra-viewmodes) and follow the install instructions described in [our plugins install secion](/plugins#instaling-a-plugin).

Activate our plugin on the *WordPress* administrative panel section for plugins.

Go to your collection settings page. Look for the Available View Modes section and check the ones that you wish to be available on theme list:
