# Plugin: PDF Exposer

This plugin adds an exposer option for rendering **PDF files** containing information from items, similar to an archival report.

## Introduction

By default, every Tainacan list or item offers what we call *Exposers* or *Alternative URLs*, which are ways to visualize your data in a different format, such as our own *JSON API*, a basic *HTML Table* and *CSV files*. They are acessible via the button "View as..". This plugin adds an extra exposer option, that renders a PDF file of the desired items list.

## Instalation

Download the [.zip](https://github.com/tainacan/wp-plugin-tainacan-pdf-generate/archive/master.zip) file from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/tainacan/wp-plugin-tainacan-pdf-generate) and follow the install instructions described in [our plugins install secion](/plugins#instaling-a-plugin).

Activate our plugin on the *WordPress* administrative panel section for plugins.
