# Creating Compatible Themes

Tainacan plugin offers managements tools for creating and organizing your repository, but in the end, publishing it online is one of the most important features to be desired. To avoid *reinventing the wheel*, all the work of having navigation menus, home pages and etc are handled by WordPress with it's own ecossystem of CMS features, plugins and of course, **themes**. 

> Themes are the default way that WordPress allows customizing the appearence of your website. They can show different layouts, font and colors, but beyound that they can offer customizations of different sorts.

Considering that, the development of the plugin was made in sync with the production of an "oficial theme", planned to attend to most use cases of the plugin, which is the [Tainacan Interface](https://wordpress.org/themes/tainacan-interface/). Nevertheless, if you are a developer and have interest on adapting your theme to support some Tainacan features, you are free to do it by using some tooling that are described in this page. Here is a summary of what you can do:

* Creating custom templates to one of [Tainacan pages](tainacan-pages.md);
* Using form hooks to add extra properties to some Tainacan Entity;
* Using the latest Block Editor - Gutenberg features;
