# Theme Gutenberg Support

As explained on our documentation for [Gutenberg Blocks](/gutenberg-blocks.md), they are the future of WordPress content edition. If your theme is able to run on *WordPress >= 5.0*, users already have available a variety of blocks to compose post and pages, such as headings, paragraphs, images, collumns, etc, which are complemented by the [Tainacan blocks](/gutenberg-blocks#os-blocos-tainacan).

Although this should work out of the box, there are things you can do, as a developer, to improve the user experience with this new feature. We'll be demonstrading them here, using most of [Tainacan Interface](https://wordpress.org/themes/tainacan-interface/) code as example:

* Support new alignment options;
* Add *editor-side* styling;
* Register color schemes to the editor;
* Register page layout templates;
* Creating special styles for container blocks.
