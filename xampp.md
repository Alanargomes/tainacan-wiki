## Downloading ##

To start, let's go to https://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html and download **XAMPP** for **windows**.

In the picture above, click on the button **XAMPP for Windows 7.3.6 (PHP 7.3.6)** to begin the download. At the end of the process, we will start the installation process by running the downloaded file.

The process is now completed and the installation is done. Leave the check box selected and click **Finish**. Thus, the current screen will be closed and the control panel box will be displayed shortly thereafter.

<br><br>

The language selection box is displayed. Choose the first option, English. Then click **Save**.

<br><br>

The control panel box is displayed as in the image above. To make **XAMPP** work, you must click on the **Start** button of the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
NOTE: These two services must be enabled whenever the server is used.

<br><br>

![](/pt-br/assets/images/xampp_11.png)

If all work out, both services will turn green, as in the image above. Now click on the **Admin** button. Your main browser (**Google Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Internet Explorer**... the one you use the most in your machine) will open with the **localhost/dashboard** address already entered.

<br><br>

## Testing ##

If the installation has been completed without problems, the screen above will appear. Now the server is working properly and we'll go to the folder where the files should be stored to appear in the browser.

<br><br>

In the image above, you can see the folder address: **C:/xampp/htdocs**.
That's where the files are to be viewed in the browser.
That's it. Now we have a **XAMPP** server running on **windows**.
