# Install and Setup #

## Before downloading ##

The Tainacan project is a WordPress plugin. So if you want to install it, the first step you should take is to have a working WordPress installation.

If you don't have one or do not know how to create it, you can start by [installing a web server like XAMPP on your machine](/xampp). Then you can [install and configure Wordpress](/wordpress).

With your WordPress installation ready, you are able to install Tainacan. Just visit the "Plugins" section in your administrative panel, search for Tainacan and click "Install". That simple. If you still have questions, you can take a look at [tainacan installation tutorial](/tainacan).

Please note that Tainacan is still in Beta version and is published only for tests and experimental purposes.

## Tainacan plugin ##

Download Tainacan from the [official WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tainacan) or install it directly from your WordPress Dashboard. You can also visit its [Github page](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan).

See the [tainacan installation tutorial](tainacan#how-to-install-the-tainacan-plugin-on-wordpress) for step-by-step installation.

## Tainacan default theme ##

Tainacan will run with any WordPress theme. However, to take the most of all it’s features, you should use a theme that supports Tainacan.

Download “Tainacan Interface” theme from the [official WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/tainacan-interface) or install it directly from your WordPress Dashboard. You can also visit its [Github page](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan-theme).
